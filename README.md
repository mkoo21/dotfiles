.config is a random backup of all configs

vscode contains the `.config/Code` or `.config/Code - OSS` settings, including the user settings under `vscode/User`

`maintenance` contains random maintenance scripts, including backing up installed package lists and docker volumes for servers running Arch (what I am using at the moment).
